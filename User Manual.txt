USER MANUAL
1.	Ensure that whatever MIPS the user uses (albeit Mars4_5.jar or MarsPlus.jar) must be in the same directory
	as all the .asm files required and the directory must contain words.txt. If complicated, please use the Mars 
	that is packaged within the submission zip file.
2.	Open Mars4_5.jar or MarsPlus.jar. Click [Tools] -> [Bitmap Display].
3.	In Bitmap Display, please change [Unit Width in Pixels] and [Unit Height in Pixels] to [8],
	change [Display Width in Pixels] and [Display Height in Pixels] to [512]. Change [Base address for display]
	to [0x10040000 (heap)]. Then press [Connect to MIPS].
4.	In Mars, click [File] -> [Open…], then type or find and click [Wordle.asm] and then click [Open].
5.	Press F3 then F5, and start playing the game.

TO PLAY THE GAME:
1.	Write word in console
2.	Look at the bitmap display tool, it should show words with color.
	Green means correct position, yellow means incorrect position, and grey means it’s not in the word.
3.	You have 5 attempts to guess the right word.
4.	There is no need to press enter, since if you press 5 characters the program will accept it immediately, 
	so if you find yourself pressing enter, there is something inherently wrong with the word you typed in.
5.	If you typed in less than 5 letters and/or you typed in more than 1 non-alphabet characters, the game will
	issue a warning, and the attempt will not be counted.
6.	After 5 attempts or a correct guess, the word will be shown.
